This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1822

Based on incbufswitch.vim (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=685)

Usage:
(1) Define a normal key mapping to :IncFileSearch or leave the default of <C-O>
(2) When activated, start typing the name of the buffer you want to switch to.
(3) Press <BS> if you make an error
(4) Press <CR> to edit the first buffer in the remaining match list
(5) Press <ESC> to quit and continue editing the current buffer

Still a little crude. Polish from vim experts appreciated!
